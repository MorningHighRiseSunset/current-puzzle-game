### language files

Language files start on the line after 4 hyphens, everything prior is metadata about the language. Some will be parsed by the locale parser

Locales are defined by their locale code, the translations are seperated by a colon (:) after the locale code.

Sometimes context clues may be neccesary for an accurate translation, everything after a semicolon won't be interpreted by the parser, therefore context clues can be given. These will be defined in the english (en) file

Capitalisation is also important, if the english words are capitalised, the translations need to be capitalised in the same (if it makes sense) place
